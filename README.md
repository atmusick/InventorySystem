# InventorySystem
IMM Inventory System Group Project

Students: Morgan Davis, Alex Musick, Dylan Boswell 

Decription: 

An infinite asteroid game that utilizes an inventory system to pick up and drop collectible powerups. 

Morgan's responsibilities: wrote the item manager and collectibles script, implemented character controller scripts into a scene and wrote the Read Me. 

Alex's responsibilities: wrote the inventory system script, utilized his character controller scripts from a previous project and wrote comments on the inventory system and item manager scripts. 

Dylan's responsibilities: implemented all inventory system scripts into scene and wrote comments on collectibles script. 




Collaboration Assessment: 

We met three times during the course of the assignment and everyone was easy to contact whenever we needed to meet up. As a group we got along well 
and the workflow was great. While finishing the project and writing the majority of the scripts, Dylan ran into troubles with his computer 
and was unable to open or reinstall the latest version of unity in order to open up our project. However, he helped Alex and Morgan while 
writing the scripts, understands the scripts and how to implement them within a scene. (Tell him to delete all those damn tabs.)
